I wrote this program for the assignment of subject Foundations of Algorithms (COMP10002). 
The program reads the inputs in stage 1, and generates the most appropriate outputs based on the inputs in stage 1, in stage 2. 
In stage 3, it concatonates the inputs in stage 1, and generates the appropriate outputs. 
Data structure such as tree, depth first search, and stack are used.
